# Computer_Networks_Lab

1) Write a program in C++/JAVA to implement - Unipolar NRZ, Polar NRZ, NRZ Inverted, Bipolar
Encoding, Manchester Encoding and Differential Manchester Encoding.
2) Setting up small computer networks and Hands on networking commands:
Set up a small wired and wireless network of 2 to 4 computers using Hub/Switch/Access point. It
includes installation of LAN Cards, Preparation of Cables/ Installation and Configuration of Access
Point, Assigning unique IP addresses and use of ping utility. Hands on for network commands - ping,
pathping, ipconfig/ifconfig, arp, netstat, nbtstat, nslookup, route, traceroute/tracert, nmap.
3) Write a program for error detection and correction for 7/8 bits ASCII codes using Hamming Codes
or CRC. Demonstrate the packets captured traces using Wireshark Packet Analyzer Tool for peer to
peer mode.( 50% students will perform Hamming Code and others will perform CRC). Further
extend it to real implementation of CRC over Ethernet standard.
4) Write a program to simulate Go back N and Selective Repeat Modes of Sliding Window Protocol
in peer to peer mode and demonstrate the packets captured traces using Wireshark Packet Analyzer
Tool for peer to peer mode. Further extend it to real implementation of Flow Control over TCP
protocol.
5) Write a program to find the shortest path using Dijkstra Equation for Link State Routing Protocol
which is used by Open Shortest Path First Protocol (OSPF) in the Internet for the network flow
provided by instructor.
6) Write a program using TCP Berkeley socket primitives for wired /wireless network for following
a. Say Hello to Each other ( For all students)
b. File transfer ( For all students)
c. Calculator (Arithmetic) (50% students)
d. Calculator (Trigonometry) (50% students)
Demonstrate the packets captured traces using Wireshark Packet Analyzer Tool for peer to peer
mode.
7) Write a program using UDP Berkeley Sockets for wired/wireless network to enable file transfer
(Script, Text, Audio and Video one file each) between two machines. Demonstrate the packets
captured traces using Wireshark Packet Analyzer Tool for peer to peer mode.
Unit-VI Application Layer
8) Understanding protocol stack of Intranet
Analyze packet formats of Ethernet, IP, TCP and UDP captured through Wireshark for wired
networks.
9) Develop a client-server using C++ or JAVA to demonstrate the behavior of HTTP1.0, HTTP1.1,
HTTP1.2 and HTTP2.0 protocols along with all success and error messages. Use Firefox as client
browser
